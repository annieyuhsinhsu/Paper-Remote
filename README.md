## Location-specificity and geographic competition for remote workers

1. Summary: The growth of remote work has led to localities competing for remote workers by leveraging location-specific attributes, as exemplified by Tulsa Remote, which increased community engagement, income, and entrepreneurship, thereby benefiting both the community and remote workers and encouraging their willingness to stay.

2. Literature: how can firms create and capture value from workers with general human capital: (1) increasing the worker's productivity at the focal firm relative to other firms (2) increasing the worker's relative utility of staying at the focal firm 
-> translate the ideas developed in the strategic human capital literature into the context of geographic competition for remote workers: (1) increase the value created by remote workers to the locality (increasing local economic activity or community engagement) (2) increase the relative utility (either from pecuniary or non-pecuniary benefits) that remote workers experience from living in the locality relative to the expected utility of living elsewhere
