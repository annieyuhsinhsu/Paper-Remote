## Location-specificity and geographic competition for remote workers
1. Summary: The growth of remote work has led to localities competing for remote workers by leveraging location-specific attributes, as exemplified by Tulsa Remote, which increased community engagement, income, and entrepreneurship, thereby benefiting both the community and remote workers and encouraging their willingness to stay.
2. Literature: how can firms create and capture value from workers with general human capital: (1) increasing the worker's productivity at the focal firm relative to other firms (2) increasing the worker's relative utility of staying at the focal firm 
-> translate the ideas developed in the strategic human capital literature into the context of geographic competition for remote workers
